                <p>
                    My name is Joe Hinkley, I am a software engineer. I have worked on a diverse set of applications 
                    including everything from a digital signage management tool for school cafeterias to a mobile 
                    application that helps hikers all around the world find trails near them.

                    In addition to my experience as a programmer, I am also a skilled Audio Engineer. Internships 
                    at three well-respected studios have prepared me for any kind of audio production whether it

            <h2>Education & Internships</h2>
            <h3>Shoreline Community College</h3>
            <h4><em>Associate's Degree in Digital Audio Engineering</em></h4>
            <p>
                I enrolled at Shoreline Community College in January of 2016 after hearing rave reviews from several 
                well-respected audio engineers in the Seattle area. During my two years there I received a great 
                education in music theory and performance, worked on a variety of audio production projects including 
                radio, TV, music, and film, and participated in extra-curricular activities such as recording and 
                interviewing teachers and students for the school newspaper.
            </p>
            <h3>Edmonds Community College</h3>
            <h4><em>Certificate of Completion in Web Application Development</em></h4>
            <p>
                Edmonds Community College was a great resource for my growth and development as a software engineer. 
                There I was exposed to fundamental concepts in frontend web development such as CSS layout, HTML 
                forms, AJAX requests, and accessibility, as well as backend concepts using PHP and MySQL. During 
                my time at Edmonds, I more than doubled my workload by committing myself to completing hundreds of 
                hours of independent study. This resulted in a very beneficial year of education.
            </p>
            <div id="timeline"></div>
            <h3>Studios</h3>
            <p>
                I have been privileged to work with some very talented people who are the top of their respective 
                fields. At Destination Marketing I met every week with Radio Producer and voice-over artist Scott 
                Burns (the first English-speaking voice of the Mario character Bowser) to collaborate on Car Toys 
                radio commercials and discuss and review the work I was doing at Shoreline Community College. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2017, I studied under perhaps the most well-known and well-respected Radio and Television Audio 
                Engineers at the post-production studio Clatter & Din in Seattle. During that time, I got to curate 
                a music library used for TV commercials, produce an orientation video for future interns, and record 
                and mix sound effects for a short film shown at the Seattle Film Festival.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later that year, I interned at SkyMuse Studios in Stanwood, Washington. SkyMuse is owned and operated 
                by the legendary TV and film score composer Ron Jones (credits include Star Trek: The Next Generation, 
                Family Guy, and The Fairly Odd Parents). There I worked on recording many Ron Jones’ originals and ran 
                live sound for multiple Jazz Forrest concerts.
            </p>
            <h3>Labs8</h3>
            <p>
                From March to June 2018 I interned at Labs8 Consulting located in Kirkland, Washington. During my three 
                months there, I collaborated with their entire marketing team to redesign the Labs8 company website. I 
                also was given the sole responsibility of creating a web application that provided lunch menus to school 
                cafeterias that could be displayed on TV monitors and automatically updated every day. The application 
                was well received and remains my proudest professional accomplishment.

            <h2>Independent Study</h2>
            <p>
                While pursuing my Certificate of Completion in Web Application Development at Edmonds Community College, 
                I felt that I could do more to improve my skills as an engineer. I committed myself to spending several 
                hours every day working on personal projects or studying languages or frameworks that interested me. Over 
                the course of the school year I completed over 300 hours of online video courses, covering a range of 
                subjects including HTML & CSS, JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB, Node.js, and many more.
